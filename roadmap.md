# Roadmap for FOSS Foundations website

This site is meant to be high-level resource for anyone interested in FOSS project governance, especially those hosted at non-profit foundations or similar organizations.  Along with some introductory info - and plenty of pointers to existing "what is FOSS" websites out there! - it will also include a rich metadata directory of major FOSS non-profits.  This resource is meant to be collaborative, and of use to researchers, project leaders, and anyone interested in sustainability.

## Version 0.1 plans

## Site Governance
