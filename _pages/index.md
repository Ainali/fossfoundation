Welcome to the FOSS Foundations Metadata directory!  We are eager to collaborate with academic researchers and open source practitioners alike on curating rich common metadata about the many excellent non-profit Foundations that either host or help open source projects.

- See the current [directory of foundation metadata](listing). 
- Read the [roadmap to see where we're headed](roadmap).
- Useful [resources to learn about FOSS Foundations](resources).
- How to [contribute to this site](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Be nice and respect our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT).
- We can help you [Choose A Foundation](https://chooseafoundation.com) for your project to join.
- Learn about your current host, [Shane Curcuru](https://shanecurcuru.org).

## Goals

- Create a rich metadata directory about nonprofit open source organizations.
- Data is easy to consume in multiple ways that are reliable.
- Website and any tooling are zero/low maintenance.
- Build simple PR-driven data submission that prevents errors.
- Attract multiple contributors that create community governance.

## Non-Goals

- Tracking commercial entities.
- Tracking non-entity projects; i.e. open source projects without legal entities.
- Fancy features, UI, or hard to maintain visualizations.
- Volunteers are welcomed to help turn non-goals into goals!
